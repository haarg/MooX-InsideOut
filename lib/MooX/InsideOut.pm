=head1 NAME

MooX::InsideOut - Inside out objects for Moo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyClass;
    use Moo;
    use MooX::InsideOut;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooX::InsideOut causes all accessors generated to be stored outside
the object itself.  This is useful for extending non-Moo classes
whose internals you don't want to change, or which aren't hash
based.

Inside out objects are not recommended for general use aside from
where they are specifically required.
